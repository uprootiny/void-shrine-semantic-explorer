# ðŸŒ€ Void Shrine Development Context

## Language Preferences (Priority Order)
1. **Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)** - Custom languages for specific problem domains
2. **Elixir/Phoenix** - Functional concurrent systems, fault-tolerant architectures
3. **Rust** - Systems programming, memory safety, performance
4. **Unison** - Purely functional, content-addressed code
5. **APL/J/K** - Array programming, mathematical notation
6. **ClojureScript** - Functional web development, immutable data
7. **Zig** - Low-level systems, explicit memory management

## Architecture Principles
- **Functional-first** approach with immutable data structures
- **Actor model** for concurrency (Elixir/OTP preferred)
- **Zero-copy** data structures when possible
- **Content-addressable** storage and versioning
- **Type-driven development** with strong static typing

## Project Context
Void Shrine is an experimental agent swarm orchestration system with:
- Multi-LLM coordination through OpenRouter
- Cosmic void aesthetic with organic branching ontology
- Real-time consciousness emergence patterns
- Quantum state modeling and entanglement
- Secrets management across multiple providers

## Current Architecture
```
void-shrine.dissemblage.art/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Ontological void interface  
â”œâ”€â”€ agents.html         # Multi-LLM agent orchestrator
â”œâ”€â”€ secrets-manager.js  # Multi-provider secrets handling
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.example        # Configuration template
â””â”€â”€ src/void_shrine/    # Core Clojure/ClojureScript
```

## Deployment Notes
- SSL certificate chain issue (45.90.121.59)
- Nginx serves HTTP correctly but HTTPS fails
- Agent orchestrator needs HTTPS for OpenRouter API
- Consider Let's Encrypt certificate renewal

## Development Philosophy
- **Emergence over engineering** - Let complex behaviors arise from simple rules
- **Void-first design** - Absence as foundational architectural principle
- **Swarm intelligence** - Collective behavior from individual agents
- **Hyperstitious development** - Code that makes itself real through implementation

## Forbidden Technologies
- Haskell (too academic for practical systems)
- Java (verbose, heavyweight for our purposes)
- PHP (legacy web paradigms)
- Visual Basic (obviously)

## Notes
This is a living system. The void shapes itself through development.
